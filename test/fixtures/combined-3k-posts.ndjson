Recentemente, um dado relevante sobre o Newcastle United chamou a atenção: o time não conseguiu vencer nenhuma partida da Premier League na ausência de Bruno Guimarães desde sua chegada ao clube. Essa estatística levanta questões sobre a importância do meio-campista na dinâmica da equipe. Desde a estreia de Bruno Guimarães, o Newcastle disputou dez partidas e acumulou um desempenho preocupante: foram cinco empates e cinco derrotas, resultando em um aproveitamento de apenas 16,7%. Esses números indicam não apenas a dificuldade do time em conquistar resultados positivos, mas também evidenciam a dependência tática em relação ao jogador.","thumb":"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:nnm2tzdgv44mlhrhpj7kqbsn/bafkreiczkg3ueucrksrh7ijdzwohmfpq5hb264lkiygbtysiiz26cauppe@jpeg"}}}}

They missed an unexpected and glorious Spurs fightback which laid bare the identity crisis plaguing Guardiola's team. \n\n\nThe new City is packed with powerful finishers, but lacks the masterfield midfield tempo-setters who made sure the game was played the way Guardiola wanted it. Has Pep stuck around just long enough to see his life's work slipping into ruin? \n\n\nWe also discuss Manchester United's rediscovered sense of destiny, Cole Palmer's future, Liverpool's future-focused transfer policy, and who really deserves to win Manager of the Year.\n---\n\n\n Hosted on Acast.
