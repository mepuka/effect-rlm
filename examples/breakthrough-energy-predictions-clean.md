2. **Filtering**: Identified 1,334 articles with prediction markers (future years, quantitative claims)
3. **Ranking**: Scored articles by prediction density using pattern matching
4. **Extraction**: Processed top 150 articles using LLM-based extraction
5. **Validation**: Filtered out vague statements; retained predictions with timeframes or quantitative claims
6. **Deduplication**: Removed exact duplicates

### Prediction Criteria:
A prediction must be a forward-looking claim about:
- Future costs, prices, or economics
- Capacity, deployment, or installation targets
- Market share or adoption rates
- Policy outcomes or regulatory changes
- Technological milestones or breakthroughs
- Timeline or deadline commitments
- Quantitative growth/decline projections
